# Berry-Princess-Game
I've coded my first 2D computer game called **berry-princess-game**. A princess collects strawberries. After she has collected them all, she has to return to her castle. This retro-style game reminds me to my childhood. It is written in C and utilizes the MLX42 library for its graphical interface.
Feel free to explore the code and give it a try!
## Controls
Use the following controls to play the game:
- **Arrow keys** or **WASD**: Move the princess
- **Escape**: Exit the game
